# Shape Information

Program that extracts information about shapes from picture. Built using OpenCV library. 

Program counts the number of geometric shapes and prints out triangle angles, rectangle side lenghts and circle radius.

Input requires an image, distance from image to camera, and a camera intrinsics file such as: 

```{"width": 1280,  
"height": 720,  
"ffx": 915.008056640625,  
"ffy": 913.262451171875,  
"ppx": 637.8966064453125,  
"ppy": 364.815185546875,  
"distortion_coeffs":  
[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]}
